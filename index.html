    <p><i>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to be the 22nd running of the
        FIFA World Cup competition, the quadrennial international men's football championship contested by the senior
        national teams of the member associations of FIFA.
        It is scheduled to take place in Qatar from <u>21 November 2022 to 18 December 2022.</u></i>&#128512</p>
    <p>
        In addition, the tournament will be the last to involve 32 teams, with an increase to 48 teams scheduled for the 2026 tournament in the United States,
        Mexico, and Canada. Due to Qatar's intense summer heat, this World Cup will be held from late-November to mid-December,
        making it the first tournament not to be held in May, June, or July; it will be played in a reduced timeframe of around 28 days.
        The first match played at the tournament will be contested between Senegal and the Netherlands at Al Thumama Stadium, Doha.
        The final is due to be held on 18 December 2022, which is also Qatar National Day.
